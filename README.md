# sort-messy-numbers
this sript craete a txt for write a list with the numbers in file txt

is very bad scrypt for sort messy numbers only works in specific cases (if are all numbers in this range of number) 

the operation depends on 2 variables ,the number x-1 and x+1 if x dont  find next number the algorithm breaks why this x-1 < x < x+1 (that vars is in code num< itr < tmp)dont have next number
